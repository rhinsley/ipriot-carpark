* The system must accurately track the status of each parking bay in real-time.
* The display must be updated promptly as cars enter or exit.
* The system should be robust, easy to maintain, and scalable for future enhancements.
* The application must follow best coding practices and include unit testing.
* You must use Git and Github for version management.

# Coding requirements

To meet the specifications of the project, you must do the following:

* Create at least three classes.
* At least one class must include three or more parameters.
* At least one class must aggregate another class.
* You should demonstrate an example of polymorphism
* Include at least two unit cases
* Create a main.py demonstrating the core interaction between instances of your classes
* Use PEP8 throughout your code and docstrings for major functions within your code

# Version control requirements

* Create a new repository and configure it with a README, .gitignore, and other essential setup files.
* Initialize your local repository and link it to a remote repository on GitHub.
* Make initial commits with the basic structure of your Carpark system.
* As you develop the system, commit your changes each time you reach a significant milestone or complete a task.
* Make at least three commits to demonstrate the evolution of your project.
* Manage any changes or improvements by committing to the repository with clear, descriptive commit messages.
